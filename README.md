## Introduction

The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It works by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. This project implements a web-based interface for the Caesar cipher, allowing users to input text and receive the encrypted result.

## Features

- Encrypts user-provided text using the Caesar cipher.
- Simple and intuitive web interface.
- Real-time encryption as the user types.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aiswarya1999/caesar-cipher-site.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd caesar-cipher-site
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start the server**:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

2. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the Caesar Cipher Site.

3. **Enter the text** you wish to encrypt and specify the shift value. The encrypted output will be displayed in real-time.
